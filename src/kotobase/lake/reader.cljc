  "Schema-on-read: the seam where an object's bytes finally get parsed, long
  after they were accepted.

  Nothing in `kotobase.lake.catalog` parses. That is what lets the write path
  take anything. The cost is paid here instead, and this namespace exists to
  make sure the cost stays *bounded to one object*:

  - **No reader is not a failure.** An object with no registered decoder is
    still landed, still catalogued, still retrievable by CID, and still
    joins against every other fact in the plane. `decode` returns
    `{:decoded? false :reason :no-reader}` and the caller carries on. A lake
    where an unparseable object is a hole in the query is a schema-on-write
    system that has not admitted it yet.
  - **A decoder that throws does not fail the query.** Malformed input is the
    normal state of real data. `decode` catches, records `:decoder-threw`
    with the message, and the surrounding scan keeps going over the objects
    that did parse.
  - **The type is a hypothesis, not a fact.** `candidate-types` yields the
    declared type first and the observed one second, and `decode` tries them
    in order. Neither was authoritative at write time and neither becomes
    authoritative here: what settles it is which decoder actually succeeded,
    reported as `:via`.

  Decoders are `(fn [bytes ctx] -> seq-of-quads)`. `ctx` carries the claim
  and object ids so a decoder can attach the rows it produces to the object
  they came from.

  Decoding is synchronous over bytes the caller already holds. Fetching them
  is deliberately not this library's job -- on a Worker that read is a
  Promise, on the JVM it is not, and a portable zero-dep library that tried
  to own both would force one shape on the other."
