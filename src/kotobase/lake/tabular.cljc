(ns kotobase.lake.tabular
  "In-place analytic query over a raw tabular file, as an `IPatternSource`.

  This is the read side the lake was missing. `kotobase.lake.reader` decodes
  an object by reading all of it and returning all of its rows; that is right
  for a 4 KB JSON blob and useless for a 40 GB Parquet file. Here the object
  stays where it is and an engine that already knows how to read it answers
  one pattern at a time.

  ## Why a triple pattern is a good fit for a columnar file

  It is a projection and a filter, which is what these formats are built to
  serve:

      [?row \"price\" nil]   -> read the `price` column and nothing else
      [?row \"price\" 42]    -> and let the engine skip row groups whose
                              min/max cannot contain 42
      [nil nil nil]        -> read everything, honestly expensively

  So the pushdown is not something bolted on: the pattern already carries
  exactly the two things the file's index can act on.

  ## This namespace does not speak SQL

  `ITabularEngine` takes a **request** -- which columns, which row, which
  equality filters -- and the engine turns that into whatever dialect it
  speaks. Three things fall out of that boundary:

  - **No value from a query is ever concatenated into a statement here.**
    Column names are checked against `-columns` before they leave, and values
    travel as data. A pattern is attacker-controlled in a multi-tenant
    deployment; a source that built `WHERE \" p \" = '\" o \"'` would be a
    query-language-shaped injection.
  - **The pushdown is testable without an engine.** A fake that records
    requests proves the column was projected and the filter was pushed, which
    an answer-only test cannot: a source that reads every row and filters in
    memory returns identical answers. That is the same hazard
    `kotobase-storage` found in its sequential CAS tests -- correct answers
    from a mechanism that is not doing the work.
  - Dialect differences (how a row is numbered, how a file is named) stay in
    the engine.

  ## Two shapes, because a table row is not a set of facts

  | shape | row means | can express |
  |---|---|---|
  | `wide-source` | one subject, one column per predicate | at most ONE value per (subject, predicate) |
  | `long-source` | one datom, in `s`/`p`/`o` columns | anything |

  A normal analytics file is wide, and **wide cannot hold a multi-valued
  attribute** -- there is no cell for `alice likes tea` *and*
  `alice likes coffee`. That is a property of tables, not a gap here, and it
  is why `datom.source.conformance` (whose corpus contains exactly that pair)
  is run against `long-source` and cannot be run against `wide-source`.
  `wide-source` gets its own suite over a corpus a table can actually hold."

    Returns a seq of maps keyed by column name (string), each carrying
    `:kotobase.lake.tabular/row` — the row's stable number.

    `:columns` nil means every column. `:filters` are equality predicates and
    `:predicates` are range/comparison ops (`:<` `:>` `:<=` `:>=` `:=`) the
    engine SHOULD push down so stats/byte-range can prune. Returning more
    rows than asked is a performance bug, not a correctness one, because
    this namespace re-checks. Returning FEWER is a correctness bug and the
    conformance suite catches it."))
