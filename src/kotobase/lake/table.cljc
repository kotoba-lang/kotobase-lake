  "A table is N files. This is what makes the lake a lake.

  Everything below here reads one object well. A lake's table is a set of them
  under a prefix — `region=east/part-0.parquet`, a thousand siblings — and a
  query over it must not open a thousand footers to answer a question about
  three files.

  ## The manifest is datoms, like everything else

  Per member: its object, its row count, its **partition values**, and its
  **per-column statistics**. All on the same plane as the catalog, so
  \"which files did this tenant land last week, and what is the price range in
  them\" is one query rather than a directory walk plus a thousand reads.

      member/table            table:<tenant>|<name>
      member/object           obj:<cid>
      member/rows             1000
      member/partition/region \"east\"
      member/column/price     \"int64\"
      member/min/price        10
      member/max/price        30
      member/nulls/price      0

  Attribute-per-column, because that is what makes it joinable. A blob of EDN
  under one attribute would be a manifest the query plane cannot see into.

  ## Members do not have to agree about their columns

  `member/column/*` records each file's OWN schema, which is why
  `table-schema` can unify them — a column added last month, a width that
  changed, a file that predates a field — **without opening anything**. The
  reconciliation itself is `columnar.evolve`, which is also where the rule
  lives that makes it safe: an absent column is all-null, so it prunes rather
  than being read to discover nothing matches.

  ## A table has a history, and it is made of pointers

  A snapshot names its members **explicitly** — it is not \"whatever existed at
  time T\", because a datom carries no time and there is no clock to ask.
  Adding a file writes a new snapshot naming the old members plus the new one;
  it never edits an existing one, which is what lets an old snapshot keep
  answering what it answered.

      table/current           snapshot:<table>|<id>
      snapshot/table          table:<tenant>|<name>
      snapshot/parent         snapshot:<table>|<earlier>
      snapshot/member         member:<table>|<cid>

  `table/current` is the only mutable thing here, exactly like a git ref, and
  **lineage is the parent pointer rather than the timestamp**: clocks on
  different writers disagree, and a history sorted by them reorders itself
  when one of them is wrong.

  ## Pruning a file is the same operation as pruning a row group

  `columnar.stats/skip?` decides whether a chunk can be ruled out from its
  min/max. A file's statistics have the same shape, so file-level pruning is
  **the same function one level up** — including the rule that matters most:
  absent statistics never permit a skip. A manifest entry with no bounds for a
  column means that file gets opened, which is slower and correct, and the
  alternative is rows silently missing from answers.

  ## Partition columns are not in the files

  `region=east/part-0.parquet` has no `region` column; the value is in the
  path. So two things follow, and both are load-bearing:

  1. A predicate on a partition column prunes **without opening anything** —
     no footer, no range read, nothing. This is the cheapest pruning in the
     system and the reason partitioning exists.
  2. A query that *asks for* the partition column has to be answered from the
     manifest, because no file contains it. Row counts are in the manifest and
     subjects are derived from the object id, so those datoms are synthesised
     without a single byte of any file.

  ## Members are opened lazily, per scan

  `open-member` is called for survivors only, inside `-scan`. Building the
  table source opens nothing. Constructing sources eagerly and merging them
  would be the natural shape and would defeat the entire namespace — the
  pruning would be perfect and every file would already be open."

(defn snapshot
  "Quads for a snapshot of `table` naming exactly `members` (member ids).

  ## A snapshot names its members explicitly

  It is not \"whatever existed at time T\". The manifest is a set of datoms and
  a datom carries no time, so there is nothing to ask a clock about — explicit
  membership is what makes \"the table at T\" answerable at all, rather than a
  question the plane cannot represent.

  ## Snapshots are immutable; only the pointer moves

  Adding a file writes a NEW snapshot naming the old members plus the new one.
  It never edits an existing one. That is the whole mechanism: an old snapshot
  keeps naming the members it named, so a query against it keeps answering
  what it answered. `set-current` moves a single pointer, exactly like a git
  ref, and it is the only mutable thing here.

  ## Lineage is the parent pointer, not the timestamp

  `:at` is metadata and nothing reads it for ordering. Clocks on different
  writers disagree, and a table whose history is sorted by them reorders
  itself when one of them is wrong. `:parent` is what `ancestry` walks.

  ## Identity comes from the caller

  `:id` is whatever the caller uses — a CID, a ULID, a counter. This namespace
  does not mint it, for the same reason `add-member` takes a `cid` rather than
  hashing bytes: identity is not the manifest's to invent, and a lake that
  minted its own would have two answers to \"is this the same snapshot\"."
