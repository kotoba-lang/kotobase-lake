  "N-Triples and N-Quads as lake rows.

  Every other format in the lake is decoded into the datom shape. This one
  **already is** it: RDF statements are subject-predicate-object, which is
  `{:s :p :o}`. So there is no column model, no schema inference and no type
  unification here — the reader is a term-to-value mapping and little else,
  which makes it the cheapest decoder in the system.

  That closeness is also what makes the three places it does NOT line up worth
  writing down, because each is silent when got wrong.

  ## 1. A named graph has nowhere to go, so it is refused

  N-**Quads** carries a fourth component. `datom.source` scans `[s p o]` and a
  lake row is `{:s :p :o}` — a **triple**, despite the name `quads` used
  throughout this repo for a collection of them. There is no slot.

  Dropping the graph would silently merge statements that RDF holds apart:
  `<a> <b> <c>` in graph G1 and in G2 are different statements, and flattening
  them makes one. So a statement with a graph is **refused by name** and the
  document fails, rather than being quietly reduced.

  This reader therefore accepts the **N-Triples subset** of N-Quads. That is a
  real limit and it belongs to the datom shape rather than to RDF.

  ## 2. Blank node labels are document-scoped, so they are prefixed

  `_:b0` in one file and `_:b0` in another are **different nodes**. The labels
  are local to their document, exactly like row numbers. Materialising them
  verbatim into a shared plane merges unrelated nodes — and it merges them
  into something that still answers queries, which is the worst kind of wrong.

  So a blank node becomes `<object-id>#_:<label>`, the same shape
  `kotobase.lake.table` uses for row subjects and for the same reason.

  ## 3. An IRI object and a string literal collapse together

  `<urn:x>` as an object and `\"urn:x\"` as a literal are different RDF terms.
  Flattened into `:o` they are the same value, and nothing downstream can tell
  them apart.

  This is **not** fixed here. Fixing it would mean either wrapping objects in
  a term record — which would stop them joining against every other value in
  the plane, defeating the point of materialising into it — or encoding the
  type into the string, which invents a syntax the rest of the lake does not
  read. Stated instead: a caller that needs the distinction should not flatten
  RDF into the datom plane, and one that is querying values does not."

(defn- coerce
  "A literal's lexical form as a native value, where its datatype names one.

  Only the datatypes whose lexical space maps onto a value this plane already
  compares: integers and booleans. `xsd:double` is deliberately absent —
  parsing it would introduce a second numeric tower into a plane whose
  ordering `columnar.stats` does with `compare`, and a mixed column of longs
  and doubles compares in ways a caller does not expect.

  An unparseable lexical form keeps its string rather than throwing: RDF
  permits `\"abc\"^^xsd:integer` (it is simply an ill-typed literal), and a
  document is not corrupt for containing one."
